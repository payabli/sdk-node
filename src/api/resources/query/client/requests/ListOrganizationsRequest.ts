     *   **You must remove `parameters=` from the request before you send it, otherwise Payabli will ignore the filters.**
     *
     *   Because of a technical limitation, you can't make a request that includes filters from the API console on this page. The response won't be filtered. Instead, copy the request, remove `parameters=` and run the request in a different client.

     *
     *   --url https://api-sandbox.payabli.com/api/Query/transactions/org/236?parameters=totalAmount(gt)=1000&limitRecord=20
     *
     *   should become:
