     * <Info>
     *   **You must remove `parameters=` from the request before you send it, otherwise Payabli will ignore the filters.**
     *
     *   Because of a technical limitation, you can't make a request that includes filters from the API console on this page. The response won't be filtered. Instead, copy the request, remove `parameters=` and run the request in a different client.
     *
     *   For example:
     *
     *   --url https://api-sandbox.payabli.com/api/Query/transactions/org/236?parameters=totalAmount(gt)=1000&limitRecord=20
     *
     *   should become:
     *
     *   --url https://api-sandbox.payabli.com/api/Query/transactions/org/236?totalAmount(gt)=1000&limitRecord=20
     * </Info>
     * See [Filters and Conditions Reference](/developers/developer-guides/pay-ops-reporting-engine-overview#filters-and-conditions-reference) for help.
     *
     * List of field names accepted:
     * - `frequency` (in, nin,ne, eq)

     * - `event` (in, nin, eq, ne)
     * - `target` (ct, nct, eq, ne)
