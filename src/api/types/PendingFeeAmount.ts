 * The difference between the configured pass-through fee and the fee amount sent in the request. When transferring funds, Payabli uses this field to deduct the fee difference and transfer the correct amount to the merchant.
 *
 * When a paypoint is set up to absorb fees, and the pass-through fee sent with the request is less than the configured amount, the difference must be covered by the merchant. See [Fee Configuration](/guides/passthrough-fees#fee-configuration) to learn more about pass-through fee settings.
